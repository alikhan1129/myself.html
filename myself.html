        HELLO,
        <br>
        a bit about me:




    <p style="font-size: larger ;font-family:cantal; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 100PX;">
        I am a boy. My name is MD ALI KHAN. I have lived in Dhanbad know as coal capital of India.
        I'm doing undergratuation (btech in cse AIML) from Dr BC ROY ENGINEERING COLLEGE,DURGAPUR
        Some of my favorite things to do are read,
        listen to music, and ride public transportation (buses and trains).
        These are activities that I enjoy immensely and indulge in daily.
        My career aspirations are to become a successful engineer.There are many people in the world who have different
        personalities. It is the personality that makes everyone different and different from others.

        We can never see two people of the same personality. It never changes and determines the quality of a person.

        I am very specific in this world and have a unique personality compared to others. I am a very responsible and
        sympathetic person.

        I always help others and try my best to solve their problems. I am self-centered, there is no enemy in this
        world.

        I always talk to others very happily with a smiling face. I am a very simple student in my school and attend
        every class.
        I have been told that I am a charming, kind, attitude-prone
        person with "oddities".
        My family comprises of five members. These members are my mother, my father, my 2 sisters, and myself
        I look up mostly to my family members, especially
        my mom, as a guiding figure in life.
        My mom is a housewife.
        My father is a bussinessman.
        He is very gentle and kind.
